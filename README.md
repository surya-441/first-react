Using this repository to track my progress as I learn react.

## Current setup:
1. Using Node JS for running JS.
2. Using Vite. Don't know why.
3. Using React JS.

## Setup guide:
1. Install Node JS. I used nvm to install the current lts version of node using `nvm install --lts`.
2. Create a vite project using `npm create vite@latest`.
3. cd into the project and run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
4. Use command `npm run dev` to start the node server.

## Lessons Learnt:
1. React is declarative meaning I don't have to tell it how to do something related to front-end. I just tell it what to do and it takes care of how to do it. Showed how vanilla js does imperative coding in this [commit](https://github.com/surya-441/first-react/commit/abed42166ceff5ecbc829f50183ef9a7896a6426).
2. Vite expects users to use jsx extension.
